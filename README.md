# covid-19-mm-maker

Hay guys, I'm going to build this design from MIT, I need someone who can write control code as shown in second picture. 
Note: 
1. You need to read this website carefully (https://e-vent.mit.edu/) especially Controls and Electrical page and it's sub pages.
2. I can provide all the necessary hardware.
3. I don't need a whole bunch of people or students who usually waste their time on discussion. I just want someone who can actually start working on his own with minimal taking. 
4. You must agreed to release your code open source.
If you are interested, write in comment. Thanks.
